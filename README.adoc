== EGMI - Eskimo Gluster Management Interface

=== Introduction

EGMI stands for *Eskimo Gluster Management Interface*. EGMI is a daemon running on machines or containers alongside
https://www.gluster.org/[Gluster FS] and taking care of managing gluster volumes and peers automatically (for most
common operations).

The fundamental idea behind EGMI is that Big Data System administrators should not have to do so much manual operations
to build and maintain a gluster cluster with its volumes and peers.

EGMI inspires from the way most widely used Big Data / NoSQL backends manage their nodes, shards and replicas
transparently, balancing new replicas to new nodes automatically whenever a node goes down, etc. without an
administrator needing to really worry about it. +
EGMI aims eventually at bringing the same level of automation and reliability on top of Gluster FS and at simplifying
most trivial aspects of gluster volumes management and repairing.

EGMI also includes a _web interface_ for monitoring and to help administrators perform some simple manual operations and
configuration.

=== EGMI Project Development  Status

EGMI is currently in early development stage but still considered _production ready_ (in terms of quality) on a limited
set of use cases. EGMI is used by https://www.eskimo.sh/[Eskimo] for Gluster cluster Management.

=== Principles

*Automatic nodes and volumes management*

With EGMI, the administrators should define in EGMI's configuration file:

* Either a *Zookeeper URL* when using Zookeeper for master election and node discovery.
** In this case, the managed nodes are discovered automatically through zookeeper
** Also, one of the EGMI instance registering to zookeeper is elected as master and will take care of global cluster
management.
* Or, in case zookeeper is not used (or used only for master election), a list of *Managed nodes*:  the set of nodes
where gluster is expected to be running. Additional nodes discovered in gluster peers are considered as well.
* *The Managed Volumes*: the set of gluster volumes to be created and managed. Additional volumes discovered in gluster
peers are considered as well.
* *The target number of replicas*: Either as a fixed number or a strategy to compute the number, EGMI will manage and
extend volumes as required to respect this number whenever possible.
* *The target number of shards*: Either as a fixed number or a strategy to compute the number, EGMI will attempt to
create as many bricks as required to reach this number of shards (distribution) times the number of replicas if possible.

*EGMI is deployed on every node running gluster*

EGMI is designed to be deployed alongside Gluster FS on every node or container from the gluster cluster. This is a
strict requirement since every EGMI instance will take care of operating the co-located Gluster FS instance. +
At every moment in time, only one of these EGMI process is acting as master and is taking decisions for the whole
cluster.

*Using Zookeeper for master election and Node discovery*

EGMI uses Zookeeper for master election. Zookeeper is used solely to elect the master taking decisions for the whole
cluster as well as discovering registered nodes and not for state storage. +
EGMI stores it's state directly in Gluster's meta data.

EGMI can also run without Zookeeper. In such case, the list of expected nodes has to be configured in a static way in
EGMI's configuration file. +
This static declaration of nodes is also required if Zookeeper is used solely for master election and node discovery
is disabled.

*Stateless*

EGMI itself is stateless. EGMI uses Gluster FS's own meta-data to store state and always returns to querying Gluster to
recover the Gluster cluster state.
Optionally, when zookeper is used, some configuration elements  (such as registered nodes) are retrieved from
zookeeper.

*UI Redirection to master node*

Every EGMI instance running on every cluster nodes has a Web UI - _Web User Interface_ - up, running and available
on the configured port. However, only the master node UI is answering. Slave nodes UI on slave nodes redirect the user
to the master node UI.

== Building EGMI

=== Prerequisites

EGMI needs following software available in order to be built:

* Open JDK 11 (or compatible) with `java` in `PATH`.
* Apache Maven 3.x (or compatible) with `mvn` in `PATH`

All the rest is expressed as maven dependencies and fetched from maven repositories as part of the maven build proces.

=== Building

Simply type on the command line at the root of the project:

`mvn clean install`

It results in a set of `zip` and _tarball_ (`tar.gz`) files in the `target` sub-folder.

== EGMI Deployment

Again, EGMI has to be installed on every machine or container running _Gluster FS_, installed alongside Gluster. +
EGMI is started using the startup script `egmi.sh` or the provided SystemD unit file and setup script. +
Java 11 (or above) binaries need to be available in the system path to run EGMI.

=== Installation

One just needs to extract the EGMI archive to the root folder where one wants to install EGMI.

=== Configuration

EGMI is configured in `egmi.properties` configuration file located under sub-folder `conf` under the root EGMI
installation folder.

The most essential configuration properties to be adapted *whenever EGMI is to be used outside of Eskimo* are as
follows.

==== Cluster and Server configuration

* `zookeeper.urls` : the URL(s) (coma-separated list of IP:PORT where zookeeper is expected.) at which zookeeper
server(s) is(are) expected. Whenever this is configured, EGMI will use zookeeper for master election. Leave it blank to
force either master or slave on one EGMI instance without using zookeeper. (See `master=true|false` below)
* `hostname` : the hostname this instance of EGMI is identified by on the gluster cluster (most of the time the IP
address of the node)
* `server.port`: the port EGMI listens to (both EGMI UI and EGMI command server)
* `remote.egmi.port` : the port where the remote EGMI command server listens to. *This should in principle be the same
port as above*. But in case the EGMI master manages a set of remote slaves running on a different port, this can be
useful.
* `target.ip-addresses` : coma-separated hostnames or IP addresses of the gluster cluster. EGMI will connect all these
nodes together (add peers in pool) if some nodes are disconnected from the gluster. +
This should be left blank to rely on zookeeper for data node discovery. EGMI is indeed able to discover the various
nodes running EGMI / Gluster cluster from zookeeper. Whenever one doesn't want to rely on zookeeper to discover nodes,
this configuration property can be used.
* `master` : set to `true` or `false` to force that very instance to be master or slave on one EGMI instance regardless
of zookeeper election process. (This should be used with caution since no checks are done on misconfiguration ending up
with multiple masters.)

==== EGMI backend configuration

* `data` : set to `true` to have the node registerd as a data node (managed gluster node) within zookeeper. Set to
`false` to have that EGMI running as a standalone process (without a co-located gluster process to be managed).
* `target.volumes`: coma-separated list of volumes to be managed. This has to be given and needs to be consistent
across EGMI instances.
* `config-storage-path`: where the EGMI runtime configuration (meta-data) has to be stored. EGMI is more or less
stateless but some of the discovered nodes or volumes are tracked in a meta-data file stored there. (If this file is
deleted, it doesn't impact EGMI significantly)
* `zookeeper.sessionTimeout` : the zookeeper session timeout (used to trigger a new master election)
* `master.redirect.URLPattern` : the URL pattern used to redirect users reaching an EGMI slave to the master.

==== Gluster Management configuration

* `target.numberOfBricks` : the number of bricks to create and manage for volumes (either a fixed number or `ALL_NODES`
to have every volume having a brick on every node or `LOG_DISPATCH` to have shares and replicas distributed on log(n)
nodes)
* `target.defaultNumberReplica` : the target number of replicas to try to respect for every node.


*Important note* +
This configuration needs to be aligned on every node. It is not a strict requirement and a configuration discrepency
between nodes may be somewhat tolerated by EGMI. +
It could however lead to unexpected results and every node in the gluster cluster should really have the same EGMI
configuration.
